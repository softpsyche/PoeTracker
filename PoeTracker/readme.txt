Yeah, ok. So just run it and minimize it. Then it works, yah? 
NOTE: WARNING TO MORONS WHO DORKS WHO WANT TO CRITICIZE THIS CODE..PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE YOU TRY TO LECTURE ME ABOUT CODING:

1.- I wrote this for myself. And it works on MY machine...lol, normally a cop out but in this case it truly is valid since I created it for myself not you chumps
so before you start whining please remember that.

2.- Code was written super simple so you can check to make sure im not trying to pull any bullshiton your machine. You can compile it yourself easily. 

3.- Yes, I know there are no tests so before you whine about it, let me answer some questions. Because I think testing is bad? no...just because it is small enough
I didnt bother to test it and i wanted to run some more maps instead of write tests.  You can write the tests. I bet they will suck anyways then
I will have to school you on how to write good BDD style tests. Don't try me...

4.- Don't you know about Dependency injection?? No whats that...um, of course asshole. I know all about it. Excuse me if i didnt want to add yet
another nuget package for some DI solution and add a dozen interfaces and shit just so you can get a boner by watching me test it and have the container
gleefully contruct all my objects via constructor injection. If you need that sort of validation, go get laid please. See 2 above as well.

5.- Couldn't you have made this a service? Yes, i could have. See 2 and 1 above.

6.- Couldn't you have used a strategy pattern and regex and MVC blah blah blah? look dude, i do this for a living and get paid well to do so. I wrote this for fun.
If I happen to get an itch i might make it better. But I am not trying to show off here.
